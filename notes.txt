- Any file with the name structure [name].[dotfile] should have its contents copied into that dotfile.
- Everything in .config goes directly in ~/.config.
    - Easy way to do this: ln -s /path/to/here/.config/* ~/.config
    - VSCode config also goes in .config but I didn't want to include all of it
      so you have to put it in "Code - OSS/User/" manually.
- Install github.com/powerline/fonts to make things look right, also ttf-fira-code for vscode.
- Awesome theme uses the Terminus font.
- Clone with --recursive to get the submodules required for Awesome.
- zsh needs the powelevel10k theme and zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin;
    these are installed by git cloning their repos into the respective folders in ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom.
